    <!-- Note: With maxLines ellipsis text is cut off or ellipsis character is not shown.
    Fixed in later versions of Android, but there maxLines cuts off text on the word level.
    The maximum amount of chars is only shown with deprecated singleLine.
    Though singleLine causes layout issues, so for now using lines/maxLines on new versions. -->

    <!-- lines=1 and ellipsize start crashes pre-L and on L_MR1.

    ellipsize start does not work on L. -->
